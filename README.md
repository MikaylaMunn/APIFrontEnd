# API Front End Development

## Purpose
 To use Django to link front end and back end in order to make a full functioning website

## Issues
I forked the front end with permission from the Justice Through Code GitHub and used it in this application, however I struggled to upload it to my own gitHub account once forked. 

## This is a sample problem for the classroom purposes.
